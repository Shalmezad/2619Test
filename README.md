========
Congatulations on making it this far. Now you need to do a couple things.

If you haven't already, create a github account. It's free, and easy.

Next, fork this repository (top right).
This will give you your own copy. 

Using the windows github app, CLONE the repository (this will add it to your computer). 

There's a file called "names.txt". Open it, and add your name.

Once you added your name:
Go in the github app, it will say there's "uncommitted changes".
Add a message (added my name), and hit commit.

Next, you need to SYNC (top right of github app). This will sync it to your repository.

Finally, click the gear, and "view on github". This will go to your repository online.
On the right, there's an item called "pull requests". Click it, and click "New pull request".

Once you submit a pull request, you're done!

To summarize:
FORK my repo (my repo [online] -> your repo [online])
CLONE your repo (your repo [online]-> your computer)
EDIT your file (your computer)
COMMIT your changes (your computer)
SYNC your commit (your computer -> your repo [online])
create a PULL REQUEST (your repo [online] -> my repo [online])

We will go over git after the kickoff brainstorming.
